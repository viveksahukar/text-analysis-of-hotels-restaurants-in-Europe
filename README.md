Sentiment analysis of the reviews has been done and it has been tried to find the important areas that users most care about. Moreover, an effort was made to see if reviews differed by city and reviewer’s nationality. The network analysis was employed to find meaningful relationships between common key words in the reviews. This approach is more accurate than “bag of words” approach and is better suited for short texts as compared to topic modeling. It was hard to find out “sarcasm” or complex sentiments during the study.

The powerpoint presentation detailing the methodology and results has been provided.

This analysis was submitted as a class presentation for final project in course "Data Scraping & Introduction to Text Analysis" in December 2018, as part of Masters degree in Interdisciplinary Data Science at Duke University.
